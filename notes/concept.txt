Concept: dying reincarnates you as a different animal depending on how you died.


human:
  default animal
  can pick up items and directly interact with environment
  can only walk and jump a short hight

fish:
  activated by drowning
  can interact with environment
  can swim and flop on land (can't interact with environment on land)

bird:
    activated by falling from a high place
    can interact with environment

worm:
    activated by being crushed
    can't interact with environment
    can squeeze into tight spaces

all animals can set checkpoints. When respawning the user can select any active
checkpoint.
